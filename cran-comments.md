## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Write in README why this package should be used other than already existing packages (e.g. 'mlr', 'rBayesianOptimization',...)

* Uncapitalize 'Optimization', 'Support Vector Machine', 'Random Forest', 'Extreme Gradient Boosting' in my description. 

* Unwrap the examples if that is feasible and if they can be executed in < 5 sec for each Rd file

## Test environments
* local macOS install, R 3.4.2
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

* This is a new release.
