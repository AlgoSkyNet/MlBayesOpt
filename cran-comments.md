## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Written in DESCRIPTION file why this package should be used other than already existing packages (e.g. 'mlr', 'rBayesianOptimization', or 'xgboost').

* Added references in the 'Description' field of my DESCRIPTION file.

## Test environments
* local macOS install, R 3.4.2
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

* This is a new release.
